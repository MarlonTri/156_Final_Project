# 156_Final_Project

The main place to look is [`notebooks/Generator.ipnyb`](https://github.com/MarlonTri/156_Final_Project/blob/master/notebooks/Generator.ipynb).

The `container` folder is for setting up the nvidia-docker container that runs the Jupyter Notebook server. You don't need to worry about that unless you want to run this project.
